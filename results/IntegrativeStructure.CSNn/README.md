## List of files and directories:

- `IntegrativeStructure.CSNn` contains the subdirectories for the non-canonical structure of CSN complex (centroid and localization probability densities):
    * [Noncanonical CSN (DSSO+DHSO+BMSO)](./IntegrativeStructure.CSNn/Structure_DSSO_DHSO_BMSO/) at a precision of 22Ã….
    * [Sampling Precision](./sampling_precision_noncanonical) contains the results of the exhaustiveness tests for the [noncanonical CSN complex](./sampling_precision_canonical/DSSO_DHSO_BMSO).
