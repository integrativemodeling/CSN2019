# Cop9_Signalosome Complex results

Directory for the main results of the modeling pipelines for the canonical and noncanonical CSN complex

## List of files and directories:

`results`   	 contains all results reported for both structures of the CSN complex
- IntegrativeStructure.CSN contains the subdirectories for the canonical structure of CSN complex (centroid and localization probability densities):
    * [Canonical CSN (DSSO+DHSO+BMSO)](./IntegrativeStructure.CSN/Structure_DSSO_DHSO_BMSO/) at a precision of 16Ã….
    * [Subsample CSN (DSSO+DHSO)](./IntegrativeStructure.CSN/Structure_DSSO_DHSO/) .
    * [Subsample CSN (DSSO+BMSO)](./IntegrativeStructure.CSN/Structure_DSSO_BMSO/) .
    * [Subsample CSN (DHSO+BMSO)](./IntegrativeStructure.CSN/Structure_DHSO_BMSO/) .
    * [Subsample CSN (DSSO)](./IntegrativeStructure.CSN/Structure_DSSO/) .
